# cancer_classification_neural_networks
This is a machine learning based project which trains a neural network using back-propagation algorithm. The UCI database for breast cancer classification is used and MATLAB nntool is used for constructing the neural network.

breast_cancer_data.csv is the data from UCI breast cancer repository and is converted to csv format for the purpose of this project.


data_input is input data containing 9 columns for 9 specific inputs.


data_output is output data giving 2 or 4 depending on the classification, whether benign or malignant tumor.


data_sample_input is a set of 10 patterns which have not been used for training and strictly reserved for the purpose of testing by programmer.
